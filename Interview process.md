### Process Overview:

1. **Mantra Allocation**: The designated mantra will be provided to the individual, who is required to submit a sample audio recording demonstrating their proficiency in chanting styles such as Krama, Ghana, Jata, among others.

2. **Text Submission Requirements**: The individual must provide the accompanying text for the mantra. For reference, only the Samhita and Pada Patha text will be supplied.

3. **Validation Procedure**: Both the submitted audio recording and text will be thoroughly reviewed by qualified acharyas to ensure adherence to chanting standards. This validation process will encompass:
   - **Varṇaḥ** (phonetic accuracy), **Svaraḥ** (intonation), **Matra** (syllable duration), **Balam** (strength), **Sama** (consistency), and **Santanaḥ** (flow).  
   - Conformance to **Chhandah** (metrical structure), such as Gayatri, Anuṣṭup, etc.

4. **Engagement and Negotiation**: Upon successful completion of the aforementioned validations, discussions will be conducted with the individual to finalize terms. Preference will be given to an hourly rate for audio recordings, though alternative arrangements, such as per specific Vedic chapter, may also be considered.
